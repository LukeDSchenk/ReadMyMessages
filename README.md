# ReadMyMessages
A simple Android Python script which reads aloud all of the unread SMS messages on your device.

This is a very basic functioning "text message voice mail" program I wrote entirely on my HTC 10 device in QPython3. I spent about an hour making this, and the functionality is very limited in its current state, but I thought it would be fun to mess around with. Feel free to use this code in any way, mess around with it, make it better, whatever you like. 

If you are interested in contributing to this simple project to turn it into something bigger, please feel free to let me know!

## Running the script
To run this script on your android device, you will need to install QPython3, or a similar Python IDE for Android.
I may or may not try and update this into a full fledged kivy Android/IOS application in the future. We'll see!
